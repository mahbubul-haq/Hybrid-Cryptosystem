## AES and RSA algorithm implementation
#### Demonstration of Sender and receiver using TCP Socket Programming.
#### Alice sends AES encrypted ciphertext and RSA encrypted AES key to Bob.
#### Bob decrypts the ciphertext using AES, after decrypting the key using RSA.

### How to run
* Run 1605051_f1.py for creating server.
* Run 1605051_f2.py for creating client.
* Dependecies should be downloaded.
